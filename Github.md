# Lazy üê∂ for Git ‚Äì and you can never guess what happens next!

*Version: 1.1.0*

The following is a short guideline for how we use Github, including common best practices for Git.

### Five (+ five) tips that will CHANGE your life

#### **1)** Pulla, pulla, pulla

Before every coding session ‚Äì that is, before you sit down and make beautiful <s>love</s> code ‚Äì make a habit of always pulling the latest changes from the repository.

This prevents you from working on outdated code. Obviously.

##### How do I do it?
Fire up your favourite terminal app and cd to the repo folder and just type in the following command:

```git
$ git pull
```

#### **2)** Branch out with your rooster out

Never (well, almost never) work directly on the ``master`` branch. It is better to create a separate branch where you can rocka loss like a b√•ss.

By working on our own branches we can develop in parallel while keeping working code intact on the ``master`` (or ``develop``) branch, and not interfering with each other.

##### How do I do it?
In the terminal, just type up the following command:

```git
$ git checkout -b <branch_name>
```

This will create a new branch named ``<branch_name>`` and also change to that branch directly.

###### Bonus tip

The ``checkout`` command is a magical one. You can use it to switch to another (existing) branch using ``checkout``, like so:

```git
$ git checkout <branch_name>
```

Or, undoing changes in a specific file and restoring them to their latest committed versions (**You will lose all your changes, so take a couple of seconds to think it through before doing this**):

```git
$ git checkout <file_name>
```

To revert all changes in the working directory, you can just type ``.`` (a dot) instead of the filename. (**It cannot be stressed enough: You will lose all your changes. Be really, really sure you want to do this.**)

To revert a file back to its state in a specific commit, you can also add the commit to the command:

```git
$ git checkout <commit> <file_name>
```

#### **3.1)** Commit to committing

Do ``commit`` often, and I really mean **often**. It is generally better to have more, but smaller commits, rather than committing a large block of code (üò©!!) at the end of the day.

A good rule of thumb is to make a new commit as soon as you can explain the change in a sentence.

Not only does this make it easier to roll back individual changes if needed, it also allows for you to share code with your colleagues.

#### **3.2)** Related changes are related

Each ``commit`` should preferably include related changes. For instance, if you've squashed a nasty bug, this should be an individual commit.

This can be done, for instance, by separating staging and committing, or committing the file before continuing to work on it.

##### How do I do it?
Stage a file with the ``add`` command, before using ``commit``.
```bash
$ git add modifiedFileOne
$ git add modifiedFileTwo
$ git commit -m "Some message"
```

You can also stage and commit all modified files:

```bash
$ git commit -am "Some message"
```

#### **3.3)** (Committing) half done is not well begun

Try not to commit work that is half-done (if not absolutely necessary).

##### How do I do it?

You just don't!

#### **3.4)** Test your code before commit

This is self-explanatory, but try to always commit code that is tested and works (again, if not absolutely needed to be committed).

#### **3.5)** Push it good

Never forget to ``push`` before the end of the day, to upload all your commits to the remote repository.

##### How do I do it?
After making one (or more commits) just type the following:

```bash
$ git push
```

#### **4)** Don't forget -- Jesus pull requests

When you're satisfied with your changes and want to incorporate those to the ``master`` branch, you should create a ``pull request`` on Github.

But always have someone else to review your changes before merging them.

##### What to look at when reviewing?

Use the following as a guide for when reviewing someone else's code (but also before creating a pull request).

* Is the code documented correctly?
* Are there any unit tests?
* Does the code run correctly on your own computer?
* Are there any parts in the code that are not executed, or returns unused results?
* Does it follow our coding convention?
* Does the code apply lagom defensive programming?

##### Who to choose as reviewer?

* Not you!
* Someone not involved in the coding.
* Preferably someone on a different platform.
* Someone not already reviewing, or have reviewed your code previously multiple times.

##### How do I do it?
After pushing all your changes to the repository, do the following:

![PR 1](PR-1.png?)
![PR 2](PR-2.png?)
![PR 3](PR-3.png?)
![PR 4](PR-4.png?)

#### **5)** Issue an issue when a bug is bugging you

Use Github's ``issue`` feature to report bugs, rather than posting it (only) on *Slack* or *Trello*.

When creating ``issues``, be specific. Use a good, clear title and paste in (using the code or quote blocks) the buggy code or error message.

##### How do I do it?
Click on the "Issues" tab in the repository.
