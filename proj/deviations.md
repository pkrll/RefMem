The project met all requirements wihtout one. Which was in the function allocate, where we are told to deallocate all standing deallocations until cascade limit is reached and if the combined size of the deallocated objects is less then the requested allocation is will keep deallocte until it reached. Our implementation iterate over the queue of standing deallocations and and sums the size of the deallocations. Which might result that we exceeds the requested size on the last deallocation. As example, 96 bytes is deallocated and 100 bytes is requested to allocate our solution will deallocate another object even if the total deallocated size exceeds 100. becuase it checks deallocted size < requested size and not deallocated size + next deallocated size < requested size.
