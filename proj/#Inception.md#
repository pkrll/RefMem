This project was conducted with the agile methodology Kanban with Trello as platform.
We chose Kanban because it was easy to learn and allowed us to work on a distance
through concrete goals represented as notes on Trello.

The application Trello allowed us to create a board with post it notes. There
we had different sections depending on which stage current note were on. The
sections were To do, ToDo: Kod, Doing, Review and Done. Those sections which were
specially adapted for this project was Doing and Review. Doing is limited to
only contain six notes. Thereby the group is forced to complete those tasks
before continuing and limit us to only work with stuff that has a direct
effect on the current progress. Review is used to guarantee some level
of correctness in the code. By forcing another project member to verify that
the code is acceptable. If not it is commented and hopefully fixed. All this is
done through GitHubs pull-request function. When a note has passed the review section
it is moved to Done. That action is represented by the pull request is merged
to the master branch.
