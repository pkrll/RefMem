## 3.1 Inception
This project was conducted with the agile methodology Kanban with Trello as platform.
We chose Kanban because it was easy to learn and allowed us to work on a distance
through concrete goals represented as notes on Trello.

The application Trello allowed us to create a board with post it notes. There
we had different sections depending on which stage current note were on. The
sections were To do, ToDo: Kod, Doing, Review and Done. Those sections which were
specially adapted for this project was Doing and Review. Doing is limited to
only contain six notes. Thereby the group is forced to complete those tasks
before continuing and limit us to only work with stuff that has a direct
effect on the current progress. Review is used to guarantee some level
of correctness in the code. By forcing another project member to verify that
the code is acceptable. If not it is commented and hopefully fixed. All this is
done through GitHubs pull-request function. When a note has passed the review section
it is moved to Done. That action is represented by the pull request is merged
to the master branch.

# 6 Work Breakdown Structure
Since we added all our tasks to trello it was easy to see what was left to be done. If something had to be completed before the project could be moved along slack was used to make sure someone was at least working on that part.
Slack was also used for communicating problems and splitting the work load, as trello makes it hard to discuss, it is more of a documenting tool.
The tasks were of very varying size, but because different memebers of the group have different amounts of experience of c as a language and of programming in general the size of the actual task had little to do with how much work was put into it. Because of this it is also very hard to estimate how long a task will take to complete. It, as usual, completely depends on how many problems you run into on the way. Our utopian goal was to be finished before christmas. Having such a big margin makes it less important that you estimate your time correctly and more important that the task just gets done in time that it doesnt stop the rest of the project moving forward.
The work was not completely balanced. Partly because team members were at times busy with other things during christmas and partly because we are not equally good at programming in c.
