Since we added all our tasks to trello it was easy to see what was left to be done. If something had to be completed before the project could be moved along slack was used to make sure someone was at least working on that part.
Slack was also used for communicating problems and splitting the work load, as trello makes it hard to discuss, it is more of a documenting tool.
The tasks were of very varying size, but because different memebers of the group have different amounts of experience of c as a language and of programming in general the size of the actual task had little to do with how much work was put into it. Because of this it is also very hard to estimate how long a task will take to complete. It, as usual, completely depends on how many problems you run into on the way. Our utopian goal was to be finished before christmas. Having such a big margin makes it less important that you estimate your time correctly and more important that the task just gets done in time that it doesnt stop the rest of the project moving forward.
The work was not completely balanced. Partly because team members were at times busy with other things during christmas and partly because we are not equally good at programming in c.
