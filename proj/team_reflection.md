# 3 Process
## 3.1 Inception
This project was conducted with the agile methodology Kanban with Trello as platform.
We chose Kanban because it was easy to learn and allowed us to work on a distance
through concrete goals represented as notes on Trello.

The application Trello allowed us to create a board with post it notes. There
we had different sections depending on which stage current note were on. The
sections were To do, ToDo: Kod, Doing, Review and Done. Those sections which were
specially adapted for this project was Doing and Review. Doing is limited to
only contain six notes. Thereby the group is forced to complete those tasks
before continuing and limit us to only work with stuff that has a direct
effect on the current progress. Review is used to guarantee some level
of correctness in the code. By forcing another project member to verify that
the code is acceptable. If not it is commented and hopefully fixed. All this is
done through GitHubs pull-request function. When a note has passed the review section
it is moved to Done. That action is represented by the pull request is merged
to the master branch.
# 4 Use of Tools
## Trello
For keeping track of what tasks were left and who did what
## Slack
For more or less all communication, within the group and with Elias.
## Github
For merging our code, review added code and documenting changes.
# 5 Communication, Cooperation and Coordination
Ardalan was the contact person with Elias, but after our first meeting Elias was added directly to one of our slack channels so anyone could ask him a question if thye wanted to. To communicate within the group we used slack, either if someone had a question, felt like they needed a task, added a pull request on git hub that needed to be reviewed or had any other relevant info or questions. Sometimes it was difficult to get ahold of members, but nobody completely disappeared for too long. We had regular meetings, not always because anyone had anything to say specifically but more to catch up and make plans for the rest of the project.
# 6 Work Breakdown Structure
Since we added all our tasks to trello it was easy to see what was left to be done. If something had to be completed before the project could be moved along slack was used to make sure someone was at least working on that part.
Slack was also used for communicating problems and splitting the work load, as trello makes it hard to discuss, it is more of a documenting tool.
The tasks were of very varying size, but because different memebers of the group have different amounts of experience of c as a language and of programming in general the size of the actual task had little to do with how much work was put into it. Because of this it was also very hard to estimate how long a task would take to complete. It, as usual, completely depends on how many problems you run into on the way. Our utopian goal was to be finished before christmas. Having such a big margin made it less important to estimate the time correctly and more important that the task just gets done in time that it didnt stop the rest of the project moving forward.
The work was not completely balanced. Partly because team members were at times busy with other things during christmas and partly because we are not equally good at programming in c.
