# Time logs

## Time log for individual team members

![Log and compilation of time](p1.png?)

The image above shows a compilation of how time much each team member has spent on the project.

There are two time columns: One contains the data that the sheet uses to generate the pie chart, and should be ignored, while the other contains each members total number of hours spent on the project.

The time logs can be found [by following this link](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ZPSiow70PjHo7CLIsuATjVtgAY0Xj8DxId5Ccrt_7GQ/edit?usp=sharing). There, you'll find more information on each team member.


## Time distribution over work areas

The first column is, again, used to compile the pie chart. The other column shows the time in a human-readable format.
